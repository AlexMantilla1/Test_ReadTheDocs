Nowadays, there is a growing demand for IoT devices to strengthen this Smart City concept, connecting all the systems in a given environment. This is great for users who have more and more options to solve specific problems comfortably, but it is a headache for the design engineers of these systems since these systems are full of limitations to consider. One of the main limitations is that energy consumption is becoming increasingly critical because these are battery-powered systems, they are systems that work with solar energy or simply because a network of systems that is more efficient in energy consumption is desired.

Within these IoT devices, there is a wide variety of applications that require digital processing, using the data obtained from the environment, a couple of those could be telecommunications, instrumentation, among others. In practice, the data obtained by the environment is purely analog, so data conversion systems, to make this data usable by the processing core (analog-to-digital converter; ADC) are needed.
