The Problem
###########

The Analog to Digital converter is a fundamental system in 
most sensing devices because it is the one that allows the
processor to read the information from the outside, it is a
block in which part of the energy demand of the SoC can 
definitely be saved, that is so the need arises for an ADC 
bounded by specific demand of resolution, accuracy, 
DNL (Differential Nonlinearity), no Missing codes, 
INL (Integral Nonlinearity), low gain and offset error 
among other performance characteristics, that also has low 
power consumption and silicon area for the targeted application 
market.

Different architectures for ADCs can be found in the literature,
such as Flash, Pipelined, or SAR, which calculate a digital 
conversion for each sample taken, very quickly. However, their 
performance is sensitive to the variations that the elements 
that compose them may have in the manufacturing process. On the 
other hand, delta-sigma modulation (∆Σ) appears to be much more 
robust for these purposes, converting the sampled analog value 
into the moving average of a signal, achieving high performance
without the need for error correction techniques. However, 
this is possible at the cost of a higher sample rate and more 
digital area.

In devices with a limited power supply, such as sensor systems 
or biomedical applications, one way to reduce the consumption 
of your systems is to lower the supply voltage. This is also a 
great difficulty for architectures such as flash, pipelined,
or SAR. However, the low complexity of the analog circuits and 
the robustness of the ∆Σ modulators make the modulator the 
preferred candidate against other low voltage topologies. 
Delta-sigma modulator designs have been reported that operate 
at voltages as low as 0.25V, but have very low 
operating frequencies. On the other hand, a topology for ∆Σ 
modulators of switched capacitor circuits based on inverters is 
implemented, where supply voltages down to 0.7V have 
been reported. Although this topology shows better performance, 
it also has drawbacks when it comes to lowering the supply 
voltage.

∆Σ ADC
********

To understand how the power consumption of a ∆Σ data 
converter can be reduced, a quick summary of the system, 
in general, is presented in Figure 1, where it can be seen 
that an ADC of this type can be separated into 3 subsystems; 
the ∆Σ modulator, the digital low pass filter, and a 
decimation filter. The objective of the modulator is to 
sample the input signal :math:`u(t)` very quickly and generate a 
quantized output signal :math:`v(t)` such that its average is equal 
to the value of the signal :math:`u(t)`, that is,

.. math::

    u(t) = avg( v(t) )

It is necessary to clarify that this is an approximation and 
for it to be a good one, the :math:`u(t)` signal must be very slow 
compared to the clock frequency with which it is sampled, 
that is, :math:`F_{CLKOS}` . With that idea let's define the OverSampling 
Ratio :math:`(OSR)` concept given numerically by

.. math::

    OSR = F_{CLKOS} / F_{CLKFS}

Where :math:`F_{CLKFS}` is the frequency of the system's sampling clock, 
that is, the actual sampling rate for each sample taken by the 
converter (this is the sampling frequency that the Nyquist 
criterion must respect to sample :math:`u(t)`), and :math:`F_{CLKOS}`
is the clock frequency at which the signal :math:`u(t)`
is oversampled to modulate it and generate :math:`v(t)`. 
Since :math:`v(t)` can then be understood as a serial digital 
signal, the objective of the digital low-pass filter is to 
filter the high-frequency components with a cutoff frequency :math:`fc = π/OSR`; 
This filter is also known as an averaging filter and it is 
necessary to realize that the length of the discrete impulse 
response of this system is directly related to the number of 
bits *N* of the converter, since

.. math::

    len(LPF) = OSR = 2^N

For this reason, it is recommended the *OSR* should be a power 
of 2, to make full use of the *N* bits. Finally, the decimation 
filter is necessary to keep only 1 of those *OSR* samples taken 
by the modulator, since each sample of the filter output 
corresponds to the average of the last *OSR* samples entered to 
the filter, thus obtaining in :math:`u(n)` a digital
version of :math:`u(t)`.

Now, let's consider ways to reduce the power consumption of this type of ADC.
Note that both, the averaging filter and the decimation filter, are implemented 
digitally, so their implementation is done using the tools and libraries of the 
technology used...so there are few degrees of freedom on the implementation, it 
is possible to reduce the frequency of the clocks and correctly reduce the number
of logic gates used, to save some energy. On the other hand, the modulator is an 
analog system where a complete analysis of energy consumption can be carried out 
and techniques for its reduction can be proposed.

Power Consumption in a ∆Σ Modulador
*************************************

The presented project is based on the implementation of power reduction techniques 
in a Delta-Sigma modulator. ::numref:`Figura 2 <Fig. %s>`  shows the classic block diagram of a second-order 
Delta-Sigma modulator to be implemented. First, it is necessary to clarify which 
sections and how these modulators consume energy. Note that for an *Nth-order* modulator, 
*N* integrators are required. For this project, 2 integrators are required for a second-order
*∆Σ* modulator. This will be the first part to be analyzed; the integrator implementation.
